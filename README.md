## Overview

This project implements a lexer (scanner) for a matrix-based programming language. The lexer tokenizes input source code and outputs a list of tokens in the format `<Token Type, Token Value>`. The lexer also performs error checking for unknown characters and syntactical issues like missing identifiers before the assignment operator (`=`).
